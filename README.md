**`ByteSize`** is a null safe library written in **Dart** language that handles how byte sizes are represented and an easy to use interface to convert to other forms of representation also taking locale into consideration.

## Usage

A simple usage example:

```dart
import 'package:byte_size/byte_size.dart';
import 'package:locales/locales.dart';
import 'dart:convert';

void main() {
    var size = ByteSize.FromKiloBytes(10000);
    print(size.toString('MB', 3, Locale.fr_CA)); // 9,766 MB
  
    var json = size.toJson();
    print(json);
    // {"b":"81920000","B":"10240000.00000000000000000000","KB":"10000.00000000000000000000",
    // "MB":"9.76562500000000000000","GB":"0.00953674316406250000","TB":"0.00000931322574615479",
    // "PB":"0.00000000909494701773"}
  
    var size2 = size.copy();
    print(size2.toString('KB')); // 10,000 KB
  
    var size3 = ByteSize.fromJson(json);
    print(size3.toString('KB')); // 10,000 KB
}
```
